# Notes

## Logic

- I chose to manage posts, users, comments state via context w/reducers
- I could have also fetched these from each of the components via useEffect()
- I added routes (posts, users and respective details) in order to make the experience more intuitive and also easier to share pages, etc.
- I realize I could have just used 'views' to 'navigate' between posts, users, etc, but the above mentioned was the better approach.
  - I strongly believe that we should not ask the user to adapt to our code, but we should adapt our coding to our users' needs.

## UI

- I used Semantic-Ui-react and Semantic-Ui-Css
- I don't personally like rounded corners, so I had to override certain semanti-ui values
- I purposedly kept styling minimal in order not to distract users and help them focus on the content

## Thank you

- Thank you for giving me this opportunity to share my passion with you, regardless of the outcome. I've enjoyed speaking with you and learning more about Delta Defense.
- Thank you for your time and consideration!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
